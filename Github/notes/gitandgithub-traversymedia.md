### What is Git? 
Git is a __Version Control System (VCS)__ for tracking changes in computer files. 

Advantages of Git & Github: 
- [x] Distributed version control 
- [x] Coordinates work between multiple developers
- [x] Who made what changes and when 
- [x] Revert back to previous code at any time 
- [x] Local & remote repos 

_Distributed version control_: Git is a distributed version control (or decentralized version control system). This means that many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network. There are version control systems that developers need to be on the same network to use. That is not what Git is; Git is distributed/decentralized. 

### Concepts of Git 

* Keeps track of code history
* Takes "snapshots" of your files
* You decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
* You can visit any snapshot at any time 
* You can stage files before committing

_Snapshot_: 


### Basic Commands 

* $ git init //Initialize Local Git Repository
* $ git add `<file>`
