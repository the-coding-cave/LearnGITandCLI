 ### Git 

 __What is Git?__

Other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time [they store data as changes to a base version of each file]. 

Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesytem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. 

__Advantages of Git__
 
 * Free and Open Source
 * Fast and Small
 * Implicit Backup 
 * Secure 
 * For small teams, there is no need for powerful hardware (central server). Deverlopers only interact with the server when they need to push and pull changes. But as the team size grows, the hardware limitations of the server can be a performance bottleneck. 


 __Getting Help__

 * `$ git help <verb>`: ex: `$ git help config`

 * `$ git <verb> --help` or `$ git <verb> --h` : ex: `$ git config --help`
 
 * `$ man git-<verb>`

 * In-person help : #git or #github channel on the Freenode IRC server, https://freenode.net/
