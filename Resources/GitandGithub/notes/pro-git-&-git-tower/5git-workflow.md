### Git Workflow 

1. __Getting a Git Repository__ 
 
     * You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways: 
         _a._ You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository to start controlling it with Git, or 

         _b._ You can clone an existing Git repo from elsewhere 
        
         In either case, you end up with a Git repo on your local machine, ready for work.
