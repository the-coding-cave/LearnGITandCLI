### How Git works

 Basic overview of how Git works (_from remote to local_): 

 1. Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool ( like bitbucket or github)
 2. Clone the repository to your local machine to get a local copy of the project (repository)
 3. Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
 4. "Push" your changes to your master branch 
 5. Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit 
 6. "Pull" the changes to your local machine
 7. Create a "branch"(version), make a change, commit the change 
 8. Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the master branch)
 9. "Merge" your branch to the master branch
